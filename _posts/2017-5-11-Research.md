title: Tracing location based on Ultrasonic sensor ! 
description: This research work designs and develops a noninvasive distance based user localization and tracking solution, DiLT, for smart systems. DiLT consists of a mechanical ultrasonic beam-forming design for omni-space sensing, a contrastive divergence learning to localize a user and a binary back-off algorithm to track the motion of the user. The research purpose is tracing the residentsâ€™ location in the smart home.

This research work focused on addressing four challenges as following:

1. <span class="t3pulishtime">Noise in ultrasonic measurement,</span> designed a robust mechanical beamforming ultrasonic system that expands the ultrasonic sensing range and capability of conventional ultrasonic sensors

2. <span class="t3pulishtime">Preprocessing outliers,</span> designed a data processing algorithm to remove exceptional and noisy data from the collected data, and transform the multiple sampled data sets into a single data set.

3. <span class="t3pulishtime">Identify target location,</span> designed a contrastive divergence learning algorithm to localize a user based on the sensed distance data with high accuracy.

4. <span class="t3pulishtime">Tracking location,</span> proposed a Binary Backoff (BNB) algorithm to track down the change of user location.
