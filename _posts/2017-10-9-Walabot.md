title: Logistic Regression classifier for Motion Recognition (Signal Spectrum)
description: This is a series of activity recognition for classify distinct intensity motions (raw data obtained as radio signal data) based on logistic regression machine learning algorithm.

### Convert to spectrum
<span>The first challenge for recognizing motion based on radio signal is extracting motion data, 
which has explained in the work <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Activity/">Activity Recognition based on radar sensor</a>. 
After obtained the “motion” data, 
we could simply feed motion recordings into a machine learning black box and train it to produce text:

<span>
In <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Activity/">Activity Recognition based on radar sensor</a>, we already can divide an 
independent motion signal wave from raw data by time-span.
So, in the next step, we need to feed these waves into computers. 
Motion waves are one-dimensional. At each moment, they have a corresponding amplitude value on wave signal. 
To turn this signal into numbers, we just record of the amplitude values at equally-spaced points.

<span>
In order to suitable for training in machine learning algorithm, we are using a mathematic operation – Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), 
which breaks apart the complex wave into the simple waves, to obtain the motion spectrum. 
The end result is a score of how much energy (amplitude values) is contained in each motion waves, 
from low pitch to high pitch.

<span>
As show in below table, FFT row denoted a pair spectrum for two distinct intensity motion. 
The depth pixel presents higher motion energy. In order to easier to recognize specific motion status, 
we are doing some pre-processing on these spectrum images based on Grayscale processing. 
As results show in table, the features of motion are more explicit to recognize after Grayscale processing.

### Logistic Regression

<span>
In this small research work, we selected logistic regression as machine learning algorithm to classify the distinct motion status.</span>

  `\sigma(t) = e^t/(e^t+1) = 1/(1+e^-t) .`
