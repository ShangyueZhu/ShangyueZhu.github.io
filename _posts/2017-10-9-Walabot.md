### Convert to Spectrum
<span>The first challenge for recognizing motion based on radio signal is extracting motion data, 
which has explained in the work <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Activity/">Activity Recognition based on radar sensor</a>. 
After obtained the “motion” data, 
we could simply feed motion recordings into a machine learning black box and train it to produce text:

<span>
In <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Activity/">Activity Recognition based on radar sensor</a>, we already can divide an 
independent motion signal wave from raw data by time-span.
So, in the next step, we need to feed these waves into computers. 
Motion waves are one-dimensional. At each moment, they have a corresponding amplitude value on wave signal. 
To turn this signal into numbers, we just record of the amplitude values at equally-spaced points.

In order to suitable for training in machine learning algorithm, we are using a mathematic operation – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)</a>, 
which breaks apart the complex wave into the simple waves, to obtain the motion spectrum. 
The end result is a score of how much energy (amplitude values) is contained in each motion waves, 
from low pitch to high pitch. As shown in below picture, it denotes an example of amplitude values after FFT processing. (Click image to view original data)

As show in below table, FFT row denoted a pair spectrum for two distinct intensity motion. 
The depth pixel presents higher motion energy. For one spectrum (Click image to zoom in), it is consisted by 20 pulses, because through numerous experiments,
 for each 20 pulses could record a complete motion. 
 For example, in walking data, each 20 pulses record a foot step. 
 And for each pulse, there are 8192 reflected points under a consistent frequency. 
 So, the dark cell in spectrum presents amplitude values of reflected points. 
 The y-axis presents the distinct frequency. For instance, in the first pulse, 
 the higher amplitude value (dark area) appeared in 0 Hz and 45 Hz. 
In order to easier to recognize specific motion status, 
we are doing some pre-processing on these spectrum images based on Grayscale processing. 
As results show in table, the features of motion are more explicit to recognize after Grayscale processing.

### Logistic Regression

<span>
In this small research work, we selected logistic regression as machine learning algorithm to classify the distinct motion status.
Logistic regression is a tool for modeling a categorical variable in terms of other variables. 
It provided ways to find out how changes in each of the other variables affects the odds of different outcomes in the first variable. 
This research work focused on extracting the motion data and convert to spectrum. 
And utilized logistic regression to provide a basic categorical based on sigmoid function:</span>  
<p >
  `\sigma(t) = e^t/(e^t+1) = 1/(1+e^-t)`
</p>
<span>As shown in the below graph, the input is spectrum image after Grayscale Processing. And the output is classification predication.

<span>In conventional, deep neural networks are grateful methods to let computer to learning from examples. 
In here, logistic regression is better working in this small dataset. 
Hence, we selected logistic regression as the machine learning algorithm. 
And the below graph displays a result for the training loss.</span>
